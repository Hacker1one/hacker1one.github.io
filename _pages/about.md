# Hi there! I’m **Abdelrahman Taha**, a junior undergraduate student and an aspiring computational neuroscientist. I’m driven by a desire to uncover the mysteries of the brain and explore the fundamental principles of how it works.



Currently, I’m deep-diving into the world of **brain connectivity**. My research focuses on the challenge of predicting functional connectivity from structural connectivity. I spend a lot of my time honing my **Python** skills (shoutout to **NiBabel**!) as I work to bridge the gap between the brain's physical architecture and its dynamic activity.

My academic journey is a bit of a mix—I’ve built a strong foundation in engineering and mathematics (especially linear algebra, differential equations, and control systems), but I’m equally fascinated by psychology and the deeper questions of how the mind emerges from the machine. I love finding ways to apply quantitative approaches like **machine learning** to the beautiful complexity of neuroscience to better understand how the brain works.

I am planning to apply for **PhD programs for the Fall 2027 intake**, where I hope to continue exploring computational connectomics and the mathematical modeling of the brain.

### Beyond the Lab
Outside of research and coursework, I have a recurring obsession with **geography**—I’m constantly trying to learn more about the flags and history of different countries. I also enjoy a good game of **chess**, coffee and exploring the beauty of the nature.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about brain networks, math, or just to say hi—I’m always happy to connect!
