Hi there! I’m a junior undergraduate student and an aspiring computational neuroscientist. I want to discover the misteries of the brain and explore how it works.


Currently, I’m deep-diving into the world of brain connectivity. My research focuses on predicting functional connectivity from structral connectivity. I spend a lot of my time in developing my **Python** (shoutout to **NiBabel**) skills trying to bridge the gap between structure and function.

My academic journey is a bit of a mix—I’ve got a strong foundation in engineering and mathematics (especially linear algebra, differential equations and control systems), but I’m equally driven by psychology and the mystery of how the mind works. I love finding ways to apply math like PDEs and signal processing to neuroscience. 

I am planning to apply for **PhD programs for the Fall 2027 intake**, where I hope to continue exploring computational connectomics and mathematical modeling of the brain.

Outside of research and coursework, I have a recurring obsession with geography—I’m always trying to learn more about the flags and history of different countries. I also enjoy playing chess and troubleshooting tricky C++ compiler errors (well, "enjoy" might be a strong word, but I love the feeling of finally fixing them!).

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about brain networks, math, or just to say hi—I’m always happy to connect!
