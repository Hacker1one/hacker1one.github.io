I am **Abdelrahman Taha**, a junior undergraduate student and aspiring computational neuroscientist. My work sits at the intersection of mathematical modeling, signal processing, and brain connectivity. I am currently focused on understanding how the structural architecture of the brain shapes its functional dynamics.


## Research Interests
My research interests are driven by the goal of creating more accurate, biologically-informed models of the human connectome. Specifically, I am interested in:
* **Computational Neuroscience:** Developing mathematical frameworks to simulate neural activity.
* **Graph Theory & Brain Networks:** Utilizing graph Laplacians to understand diffusion and information flow.
* **Signal Processing:** Applying Fourier analysis and filtering techniques to neuroimaging data.


## Background
My academic foundation is built on a rigorous exploration of engineering and psychology. I have a strong interest in:
* **Mathematics:** Linear algebra (subspaces, vector dimensions) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
* **Systems & Control:** Applying control theory concepts to biological systems.
* **Programming:** Developing and debugging performance-critical simulations in **C++**.

## Looking Ahead
I am currently preparing for PhD applications for the **Fall 2027** cycle. I am eager to join a laboratory focused on computational connectomics and the biophysical modeling of brain networks.
